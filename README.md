# 🧠 Voice-Controlled Home Assistant (with Indirect Intent Recognition)
This is a lightweight voice assistant that understands indirect speech commands using speech-to-text transcription and sentence embedding-based intent detection. Built with FastAPI, Whisper, and SentenceTransformers, it controls virtual devices like lights, fan, heater, and music through natural voice interactions.

## ✨ Features
1) Real-time voice input via microphone
2) Transcribes audio using Whisper
3) Understands indirect commands like “it’s too cold” → turn on heater
4) Manages device states (on/off)
5) Resolves ambiguous intents contextually based on current states
6) FastAPI-based API with optional frontend
